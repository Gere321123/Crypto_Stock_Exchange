# Crypto Stock Exchange

**Crypto Stock Exchange** is a startup aimed at revolutionizing how companies raise funds from investors. Our platform enables companies to tokenize their equity and offer it to investors in a cost-effective manner. Unlike traditional stock markets, where listing can cost at least â‚¬100,000 in Eastern European countries, our solution is much more affordable.

## Key Features

1. **Affordable Tokenization:** Companies can tokenize their equity at a fraction of the cost of traditional stock markets.
2. **Decentralized Dividends:** Investors earn dividends if companies generate profits. This creates transparency and aligns incentives between companies and their investors.
3. **Stable Crypto Ecosystem:** 
   - Initially, our platform was based on Ethereum.
   - We are transitioning to **RSK** to utilize Bitcoin for increased stability, as Bitcoin has a larger market capitalization and is expected to provide long-term reliability.

## Why Use Bitcoin Instead of Ethereum?

- **Market Stability:** Bitcoin's larger market cap makes it less volatile compared to Ethereum.
- **Investor Confidence:** With more liquidity in Bitcoin, investors are likely to feel more secure.
- **Future Growth:** Bitcoin's adoption continues to grow, reinforcing its position as the backbone of decentralized finance.

## Project Development Status

The project is currently in its early stages, and the platform is being rewritten to work on **RSK**, a smart contract platform powered by Bitcoin.


We are excited to continue improving and welcome feedback from the community to make **Crypto Stock Exchange** the go-to platform for decentralized fundraising.
